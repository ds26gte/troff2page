On November 14, 1885, Senator & Mrs. Leland Stanford called
together at their San Francisco mansion the 24 prominent men who had
been chosen as the first trustees of The Leland Stanford Junior University.
They handed to the board the Founding Grant of the University, which they
had executed three days before. This document — with various amendments,
legislative acts, and court decrees — remains as the University’s charter.
In bold, sweeping language it stipulates that the objectives of the University
are “to qualify students for personal success and direct usefulness in life;
and to promote the publick welfare by exercising an influence in behalf of
humanity and civilization, teaching the blessings of liberty regulated by
law, and inculcating love and reverence for the great principles of
government as derived from the inalienable rights of man to life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.” 

¿But aren’t Kafka’s Schloß and Æsop’s Œuvres
often naïve  vis-à-vis the dæmonic phœnix’s official rôle
in fluffy soufflés?
