.LP
Let’s use .char to convert the currency sign to a section sign.
.char ¤ §
.PP
Text fenced by .EX/.EE renders as a monospace display only if
troff2page is called with the -man or -mpca options.
Backslash-qua-escape can be used, so backslash can’t be verbatim:
use \ee or a .char kludge. Backslash-qua-escape is useful
especially if UTF-8 characters are used either directly or via
transliteration. It also allows the display to cross page
boundaries.
.EX
  Velit fuga maxime qui sunt
      \[u00B6] (<- backslash isn't verbatim)
      ¶ ❡ 9 o’clock (<- UTF-8 chars render as-is)
      ¤ (<- .char is respected)
  necessitatibus. Distinctio vitae
  perferendis aut et magni
          voluptatem. Quo reiciendis nam
          reiciendis sed ut atque
  laboriosam.
.EE
If you want backslash verbatim, and are willing to forgo UTF-8,
call .EX with some (any) argument. Page boundaries can’t be
crossed, as groff needs backslash-qua-escape at page breaks.
Troff2page, unlike groff, will allow direct UTF-8 (not \e[uxxxx])
regardless, and page boundary considerations are anyway
irrelevant in HTML.
