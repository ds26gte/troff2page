.SH "NAME"
troff2page \- makes Web pages from troff documents
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
troff2page <pathname>
troff2page \-\-help
troff2page \-\-version
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
troff2page converts troff (man and ms) documents into HTML web
pages. With the aid of html2info(1), it can also convert them to
GNU Info documents.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
troff2page jobname.ms
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
creates an output HTML document that consists of \f[CR]jobname.html\fP
and possibly other files \f[CR]jobname\-Z\-H\-1.html\fP,
\f[CR]jobname\-Z\-H\-2.html\fP, etc., which are linked by navigation to
\f[CR]jobname.html\fP.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
troff2page \-\-version
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
displays the troff2page version.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
troff2page \-\-help
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
displays the version and a pointer to the comprehensive online
manual, \c
.URL "http://ds26gte.github.io/troff2page/index.html" "" ","
whose
troff source is included in the troff2page distribution.
.sp
troff2page called with no argument exits with a “called with no
argument” message.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
troff2page does not support true options as groff can. Indeed,
\f[CR]\-\-help\fP and \f[CR]\-\-version\fP are not true options: if they happen to
name actual files, troff2page will attempt to process them as
input documents.
.sp
However, additional information may fed to troff2page via the
specially named macro file \f[CR].troff2pagerc.tmac\fP. Thus, a \f[CR]\-mpca\fP
groff option would translate to the line
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.mso pca.tmac
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
in \f[CR].troff2pagerc.tmac\fP.
.sp
troff2page loads \f[CR].troff2pagerc.tmac\fP, if it can find it in
directories for macro files, before processing its argument file.
.sp
Note that groff itself does not load \f[CR].troff2pagerc.tmac\fP
automatically.  But that is presumably OK, since you are using
command\-line options to specify the same information anyway.  If
you do want groff to pick up this file, you can use the option
\f[CR]\-m.troff2pagerc\fP.
.sp
If the input file is recognizably a man page (i.e., it has the command
\f[CR].TH\fP), both troff2page and groff will load, if it exists, the init file
\f[CR]man.local\fP in the home directory.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.sp
troff2page recognizes most of the commands (requests, macros,
diversions, strings, escapes, glyphs) of raw troff and its ms and man
macro packages. The syntax recognized is the improved kind supported by
.URL "http://groff.ffii.org" "groff" " "
and
.URL "http://heirloom.sf.net/doctools.html" "Heirloom troff" ","
i.e., macro, string, and glyph names
can be arbitrarily long, and strings can have arguments.  Most of the
commands are converted to their obvious HTML equivalent.  E.g., ms’s
footnotes have a straightforward translation in the HTML, with the
footnote text set at the bottom of the HTML page, and with the footnote
markers in the body and the footnote hyperlinking to each other.  Please
consult troff and groff documentation for the commands.
.sp
The troff2page distribution also includes the \f[CR]mpca\fP submodule
that contains several useful macro files. Both groff and
troff2page can process these macro files, and give compatible
results. Please see the troff2page manual for further details.
.SH "INFO DOCS"
.sp
You can call the macro
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.troff2info
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
within your document to signal to troff2page that it should also
create an Info document.
.sp
A good place to place the \f[CR].troff2info\fP call is in your
\f[CR].troff2pagerc.tmac\fP file, as it is relevant only to troff2page
and not to groff.
.SH "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS"
.sp
The script \f[CR]troff2page\fP runs on the Unix command\-line on Cygwin, Linux,
Mac OS X, and Solaris.  It uses the Common Lisp implementation mentioned
in the shell environment variable \f[CR]LISP\fP, which can currently be set to
either \f[CR]clisp\fP, \f[CR]clozure\fP, \f[CR]cmu\fP, \f[CR]ecl\fP or \f[CR]sbcl\fP: the corresponding Lisp
implementations being
.URL "http://clisp.sf.net" "CLISP" ","
.URL "http://ccl.clozure.com" "Clozure CL" ","
.URL "http://cmucl.org" "CMUCL" ","
.URL "http://ecls.sf.net" "ECL" ","
and
.URL "http://sbcl.sf.net" "SBCL" "."
.sp
If \f[CR]LISP\fP is not
set, some default Lisp implementation is assumed.
.sp
It is not necessary to run the file \f[CR]troff2page\fP as a Unix script.  You
can simply load \f[CR]troff2page\fP (it is a Lisp file) into your Common Lisp,
and then call the Lisp procedure \f[CR]troff2page:troff2page\fP (i.e., the
procedure named \f[CR]troff2page\fP in the package \f[CR]troff2page\fP) on your source
document.  E.g.,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
(load "pathname/of/troff2page")
(troff2page:troff2page "pathname/of/troff\-document.ms")
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The procedure \f[CR]troff2page:troff2page\fP can be called
several times, on the same or different documents, from
within the same Lisp session.
.sp
For more information, please see the file \f[CR]INSTALL.adoc\fP in the
distribution.
