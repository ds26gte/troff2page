= html2info(1)

== NAME

html2info - converts troff2page- and tex2page-generated HTML
documents to GNU Info docs.

== SYNOPSIS

    html2info <pathname>

== DESCRIPTION

html2info converts HTML documents created by troff2page(1) or
tex2page(1) into GNU Info documents. While it can be used by
itself, it is also automatically invoked by troff2page(1) provided
the document contains the macro call:

    .troff2info

A good place to place the .troff2info call is in the
`.troff2pagerc.tmac` macro file, which troff2page(1) always takes
care to load if it can find it.

== AVAILABILITY

html2info is part of the troff2page(1) distribution.
