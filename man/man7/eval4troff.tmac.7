.SH "NAME"
eval4troff \- groff macros for using Common Lisp as extension language
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
eval4troff.tmac can be loaded as the \f[CR]groff(1)\fP command\-line option
\f[CR]\-meval4troff.tmac\fP.
.sp
Alternatively, it can loaded within a groff document as:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.mso eval4troff.tmac
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The groff macro file \f[CR]eval4troff.tmac\fP allows you to extend groff using
Common Lisp, i.e., Common Lisp code embedded in a groff document can
be used to affect how \f[CR]groff(1)\fP and \f[CR]troff2page(1)\fP process the document.
.sp
\f[CR]eval4troff.tmac\fP provides two macros: \f[CR].eval\fP and its closer
\f[CR].endeval\fP.  You
should put \f[CR]eval4troff.tmac\fP in a macro directory, so it can be
conveniently loaded using the \f[CR].mso\fP request.
.sp
\f[CR].eval\fP does only one thing: It allows you to place arbitrary Lisp code
until the following \f[CR].endeval\fP, and the text written to standard output
by this Lisp code is substituted for the \f[CR].eval\fP ... \f[CR].endeval\fP.  The
usefulness of this tactic will be apparent from an example.  Consider
the following groff document, \f[CR]tau.1\fP:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.mso eval4troff.tmac
\&.
The ratio of the circumference of a circle to
its radius is \(rs(*t \(rs(~=
\&.eval
;following prints tau, because cos(tau/2) = \-1
(princ (* 2 (acos \-1)))
(princ ".")
(terpri)
\&.endeval
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Run groff, in unsafe mode, on \f[CR]tau.1\fP:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
groff \-z \-U \-ms tau.1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
(The \f[CR]\-z\fP avoids generating output, because we are not ready for it
yet.  The \f[CR]\-U\fP runs in “unsafe” mode, i.e., it allows the writing of
aux files.)
You will find that the groff call produces a message like
the following:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.trofftemp.lisp missing for this run
Rerun groff with \-U
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Call groff again as follows:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
groff \-U \-ms tau.1 > tau.ps
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\f[CR]tau.ps\fP will now look like:
.in +.3i
.ll -.3i
.nf
.sp
The ratio of the circumference of a circle to
its radius is τ ≈ 6.2831855.
.fi
.br
.in
.ll
.sp
The first groff call produces a Lisp file
\f[CR].trofftemp.lisp\fP.
(This name may be different based on
your setting of \f[CR]\(rs*[AUXF]\fP.)
.sp
The second groff
call invokes Lisp to create an auxiliary file for each \f[CR].eval\fP that gets sourced
back into the document.
.SH "USE WITH TROFF2PAGE"
.sp
It is clear that Lisp code via \f[CR].eval\fP can
serve as a very powerful second extension language
for groff.  This benefit is available even when the document
is processed by troff2page:
We could run troff2page on the same document, \f[CR]tau.1\fP, and the
resulting \f[CR]tau.html\fP will show the same content.
.sp
Furthermore, we can embed  \f[CR].eval\fP\-enclosed Lisp code inside an
\f[CR].if\fP (or \f[CR].ie\fP or \f[CR].el\fP) statement so that it gets executed
only for troff or only for troff2page.  (Recall we used the number register
\f[CR]\(rsn[.troff2page]\fP for this purpose.)  In
particular, by calling Lisp code only for troff2page, the
user has the
means to extend troff2page to deal with things that the core
program as supplied does
not.
.sp
Note that when troff2page sees \f[CR].eval\fP\-enclosed Lisp code, it runs it in
a Lisp environment that has not only the basic Common Lisp language but
also includes the procedures and data structures defined in troff2page.
These extras are not available (and are arguably not useful) to the
\f[CR].eval\fP code seen by troff.
.SH "DEFINING COLOR NAMES USING HSL"
.sp
For a more substantial example of \f[CR].eval\fP’s use, consider defining
color names using the HSL (hue/saturation/lightness) scheme rather than the
RGB and CMYK schemes provided by groff.  For instance, we would like to
define the color Venetian red using its HSL spec (357°, 49%,
24%), which to many is a more intuitive description than RGB
(91, 31, 34).
.sp
While there is an
.URL "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HSL_color_space" "algorithm" ""
to convert HSL to RGB,
implementing it using groff’s limited arithmetic is tedious.  Instead, we shall define a
much easier Lisp procedure to do the same, and put it inside an
\f[CR].eval\fP:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.mso eval4troff.tmac
\&.
\&.eval
(defun between\-0\-and\-1 (n)
(cond ((< n 0) (+ n 1))
      ((> n 1) (\- n 1))
      (t n)))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
(defun tc\-to\-c (tc p q)
(cond ((< tc 1/6)
       (+ p (* (\- q p) 6 tc)))
      ((and (<= 1/6 tc) (< tc 1/2))
       q)
      ((and (<= 1/2 tc) (< tc 2/3))
       (+ p (* (\- q p) 6 (\- 2/3 tc))))
      (t p)))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
(defun hsl\-to\-rgb (h s l)
(setq h (/ (mod h 360) 360))
(let* ((q (cond ((< l 1/2) (* l (+ 1 s)))
                (t (+ l s (* \-1 l s)))))
       (p (\- (* 2 l) q))
       (tr (between\-0\-and\-1 (+ h 1/3)))
       (tg (between\-0\-and\-1 h))
       (tb (between\-0\-and\-1 (\- h 1/3))))
  (values (tc\-to\-c tr p q)
          (tc\-to\-c tg p q)
          (tc\-to\-c tb p q))))
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
(defun def\-hsl\-color (name h s l)
(multiple\-value\-bind (r g b) (hsl\-to\-rgb h s l)
  (format t ".defcolor ~a rgb ~a ~a ~a~%" name r g b)))
\&.endeval
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Here, the Lisp procedure \f[CR]def\-hsl\-color\fP takes an HSL spec and
writes out the equivalent RGB groff definition. (The troff2page
distribution provides \f[CR]def\-hsl\-color\fP in the macro file
\f[CR]defhsl.tmac\fP.)
.sp
We can call this Lisp procedure inside another \f[CR].eval\fP to define
\f[CR]venetianred\fP using its HSL spec:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.eval
(def\-hsl\-color "venetianred" 357 .49 .24)
\&.endeval
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The color name \f[CR]venetianred\fP can now be used like any other groff color name:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Prismacolor\(aqs burnt ochre pencil is a close match for Derwent\(aqs
\(rsm[venetianred]Venetian red\(rsm[], and either can be used to
emulate the sanguine chalk drawings of the Old Masters.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.SH "EXTENDING TROFF2PAGE ONLY"
.sp
troff2page treats troff’s \f[CR].ig\fP environment, whenever it uses
\f[CR]##\fP as ender,
as containing Lisp code that can be used to extend troff2page.  This
syntactic overloading of \f[CR].ig ##\fP is an innovation introduced by Oliver
Laumann’s
.URL "http://www\-rn.informatik.uni\-bremen.de/software/unroff" "unroff" "."
.sp
Any Lisp code enclosed within
\f[CR].ig ##\fP ... \f[CR].##\fP will be processed by
troff2page but not by
troff, which treats it as a multiline comment of course.
Note that \f[CR].ig ##\fP does not pipe its stdout back into
the document, as \f[CR].eval\fP does.  This is to maintain the invariant
that as far as output is
concerned, \f[CR].ig ##\fP, like other \f[CR].ig\fPs, is always a
comment.  However, you can add Lisp code within \f[CR].ig ##\fP
to influence how troff2page — but not troff! — processes the rest of the
document.
.sp
For example, let’s define a
\f[CR]\(rs*[url]\fP string register that simply typesets its URL
argument within angle brackets.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.ds url \(rs(la\(rsfC\(rs\$1\(rsfP\(rs(ra
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This is adequate for the print output.
For troff2page though, we’d like to
re\-define this macro, in Lisp, to create a hyperlink.
We enclose this re\-definition in a \f[CR].ig ##\fP, which not
only allows it to be in Lisp, but also makes it apply only
when troff2page reads it:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.ig ##
(defstring "url"
(lambda (url)
  (concatenate \(aqstring
    (link\-start url)
    url
    (link\-stop))))
\&.##
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The procedures \f[CR]defstring\fP, \f[CR]link\-start\fP, and
\f[CR]link\-stop\fP are defined in the troff2page code.
.sp
\f[CR].ig ##\fP can be used to specify settings that are relevant only
when troff2page is used on a document, e.g., stylesheet changes.
troff2page uses the output\-port \f[CR]*css\-port*\fP to
write out style information.  The user can also write to this port, e.g.,
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
\&.ig ##
(format *css\-port* "
  h1,h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 {
      color: rgb(61,35,39); /* chocolate */
  }
  ")
\&.##
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
This sets the HTML headers with a foreground color of chocolate.
.SH "SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS"
.sp
\f[CR]eval4troff.tmac\fP uses the Common Lisp implementation mentioned in the
shell environment variable \f[CR]LISP\fP, which can currently be set to either
\f[CR]clisp\fP, \f[CR]clozure\fP, \f[CR]cmu\fP, or \f[CR]sbcl\fP: the corresponding Lisp implementations
being \c
.URL "http://clisp.sf.net" "CLISP" ","
.URL "http://ccl.clozure.com" "Clozure CL" ","
.URL "http://cmucl.org" "CMUCL" ","
.URL "http://ecls.sf.net" "ECL" ","
and
.URL "http://sbcl.sf.net" "SBCL" "."
.sp
If \f[CR]LISP\fP is not
set, \f[CR]sbcl\fP is assumed on Linux, \f[CR]clozure\fP on Mac OS X, and
\f[CR]clisp\fP on other
systems.
